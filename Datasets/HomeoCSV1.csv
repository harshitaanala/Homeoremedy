ARTHRITIS,,,,Arthritis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the joints  whose origin is rheumatic or infectious.  Generally  it is a benign disease  but it may be very disabling.  In most cases  this may be caused by the abnormal friction of a tendon\u2018s fibers  abnormally solicited  on a bone or a joint Rhus Toxicodendron will help you relieve your joints and also the stiff neck and the small of your back  inflaming the pain during cold days and alleviating it during warm and dry days  or after exercise.  I suggest you to take one dose of 30 CH once a day  or one dose of 12 CH twice a day.  A similar dose of Bryonia will relieve you if you have stiff and painful joints which tend to become hot and swollen  that hurt when you move.
